Tentcl is a small hand-parsed Tcl interpreter. This project was undertaken
to better my understanding of the parsing and interpretation of programming
languages. It is by no means complete, nor is it well-written -- as it is
more of an exploratory project rather than something to use.

For license details, see LICENSE

A Makefile is provided for building the project.
